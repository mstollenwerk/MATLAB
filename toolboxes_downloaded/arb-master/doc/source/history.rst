2020-06-25 -- version 2.18.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support MinGW64.
* Added version numbers (__ARB_VERSION, __ARB_RELEASE, ARB_VERSION) to arb.h.

2020-06-09 -- version 2.18.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* General

  * Flint 2.6 support.
  * Several build system improvements (contributed by Isuru Fernando).
  * Changed arf_get_mpfr to return an MPFR underflow/overflow result
    (rounding to 0 or infinity with the right sign and MPFR overflow flags)
    instead of throwing flint_abort() if the exponent is out of bounds for MPFR.
  * Documentation and type corrections (contributed by Joel Dahne).

* Arithmetic

  * The number of iterations per precision level in arb_fmpz_poly_complex_roots
    has been tweaked to avoid extreme slowdown for some polynomials with
    closely clustered roots.
  * Added arb_contains_interior, acb_contains_interior.

* Special functions

  * Fixed unsafe shifts causing Dirichlet characters for certain moduli
    exceeding 32 bits to crash.
  * Added acb_agm for computing the arithmetic-geometric mean of two complex
    numbers.
  * acb_elliptic_rj now uses a slow fallback algorithm in cases where Carlson's
    algorithm is not known to be valid. This fixes instances where
    acb_elliptic_pi, acb_elliptic_pi_inc and acb_elliptic_rj previously ended
    up on the wrong branch. Users should be cautioned that the new version can
    give worse enclosures and sometimes fails to converge in some cases where
    the old algorithm did (the pi flag for acb_elliptic_pi_inc is useful as a
    workaround).
  * Optimized some special cases in acb_hurwitz_zeta.

    mag_dump_str, mag_load_str, mag_dump_file, mag_load_file)
    (contributed by Julian Rüth).
  * Removed many obsolete fmpr methods and de-inlined several helper functions
    to slightly improve compile time and library size.
  * Fixed a namespace clash for an internal function (contributed by Julian Rüth).
  * Added the helper function arb_sgn_nonzero.
  * Added the helper function acb_rel_one_accuracy_bits.

    zeta function using Turing's method (acb_dirichlet_zeta_zero)
    (contributed by D.H.J. Polymath).

    given height using Turing's method (acb_dirichlet_zeta_nzeros)

  * Added acb_dirichlet_zeta_deriv_bound for quickly bounding the derivative
    of the Riemann zeta function.

    (acb_dirichlet_platt_multieval) (contributed by D.H.J. Polymath).

* Other special functions

  * Improved the algorithm in acb_hypgeom_u to estimate precision loss
    more accurately.
  * Implemented Coulomb wave functions (acb_hypgeom_coulomb,
    acb_hypgeom_coulomb_series and other functions).
  * Faster algorithm for Catalan's constant.
  * Added acb_modular_theta_series.
  * Added arb_poly_sinc_pi_series (contributed by D.H.J. Polymath).

    at high precision (reported by Mark Watkins).

    with simple eigenvalues.
  * Added acb_mat_eig_simple_vdhoeven_mourrain, acb_mat_eig_simple for fast
    certified diagonalization of matrices with simple eigenvalues.
  * Added acb_mat_eig_multiple_rump, acb_mat_eig_multiple for certified
    computation of eigenvalues with possible overlap.
  * Added acb_mat_eig_global_enclosure for fast global inclusion of eigenvalues
    without isolation.
  * Added arb_mat_companion, acb_mat_companion for constructing companion
    matrices.

2018-02-23 -- version 2.13.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Major bugs

  * Fixed rounding direction in arb_get_abs_lbound_arf() which in some cases
    could result in an invalid lower bound being returned, and added forgotten
    test code for this and related functions (reported by deinst). Although
    this bug could lead to incorrect results, it probably had limited impact in
    practice (explaining why it was not caught indirectly by other test code)
    since a single rounding in the wrong direction in this operation generally
    will be dwarfed by multiple roundings in the correct direction in
    surrounding operations.

* Important notes about bounds

  * Many functions have been modified to compute tighter enclosures
    when the input balls are wide. In most cases the bounds should be
    improved, but there may be some regressions. Bug reports about any
    significant regressions are welcome.
  * Division by zero in arb_div() has been changed to return [NaN +/- inf]
    instead of [+/- inf]. This change might be reverted in the future if it
    proves to be too inconvenient. In either case, users should only assume
    that division by zero produces something non-finite, and user code that
    depends on division by zero to produce [0 +/- inf] should be modified to
    handle zero-containing denominators as a separate case.

* Improvements to arithmetic and elementary functions

  * Faster implementation of acb_get_mag_lower().
  * Optimized arb_get_mag_lower(), arb_get_mag_lower_nonnegative().
  * Added arb_set_interval_mag() and arb_set_interval_neg_pos_mag() for
    constructing an arb_t from a pair of mag_t endpoints.
  * Added mag_const_pi_lower(), mag_atan(), mag_atan_lower().
  * Added mag_div_lower(), mag_inv(), mag_inv_lower().
  * Added mag_sqrt_lower() and mag_rsqrt_lower().
  * Added mag_log(), mag_log_lower(), mag_neg_log(), mag_neg_log_lower().
  * Added mag_exp_lower(), mag_expinv_lower() and tweaked mag_exp().
  * Added mag_pow_fmpz_lower(), mag_get_fmpz(), mag_get_fmpz_lower().
  * Improved arb_exp() for wide input.
  * Improved arb_log() for wide input.
  * Improved arb_sqrt() for wide input.
  * Improved arb_rsqrt() for wide input.
  * Improved arb_div() for wide input.
  * Improved arb_atan() for wide input and slightly optimized arb_atan2()
    for input spanning multiple signs.
  * Improved acb_rsqrt() for wide input and improved stability of this
    function generally in the left half plane.
  * Added arb_log_hypot() and improved acb_log() for wide input.
  * Slightly optimized trigonometric functions (acb_sin(), acb_sin_pi(),
    acb_cos(), acb_cos_pi(), acb_sin_cos(), acb_sin_cos_pi()) for pure real or
    imaginary input.

* Special functions

  * Slightly improved bounds for gamma function (arb_gamma(), acb_gamma(),
    arb_rgamma(), acb_rgamma()) for wide input.
  * Improved bounds for Airy functions for wide input.
  * Simplifications to code for computing Gauss period minimal polynomials
    (contributed by Jean-Pierre Flori).
  * Optimized arb_hypgeom_legendre_p_ui() further by avoiding divisions in the
    basecase recurrence and computing the prefactor more quickly in the
    asymptotic series (contributed by Marc Mezzarobba).
  * Small further optimization of arb_hypgeom_legendre_p_ui_root()
    (contributed by Marc Mezzarobba).
  * Improved derivative bounds for Legendre polynomials (contributed by
    Marc Mezzarobba).

* Numerical integration

  * Increased default quadrature deg_limit at low precision to improve
    performance for integration of functions without singularities near the
    path.
  * Added several more integrals to examples/integrals.c
  * Added utility functions acb_real_abs(), acb_real_sgn(),
    acb_real_heaviside(), acb_real_floor(), acb_real_ceil(), acb_real_min(),
    acb_real_max(), acb_real_sqrtpos(), useful for numerical integration.
  * Added utility functions acb_sqrt_analytic(), acb_rsqrt_analytic(),
    acb_log_analytic(), acb_pow_analytic() with branch cut detection, useful
    for numerical integration.

* Build system and compatibility issues

  * Removed -Wl flag from Makefile.subdirs to fix "-r and -pie may not be used
    together" compilation error on some newer Linux distributions (reported
    by many users).
  * Fixed broken test code for l_vec_hurwitz which resulted in spurious
    failures on 32-bit systems (originally reported by Thierry Monteil on
    Sage trac).
  * Avoid using deprecated MPFR function mpfr_root() with MPFR
    versions >= 4.0.0.
  * Remark: the recently released MPFR 4.0.0 has a bug in mpfr_div() leading
    to test failures in Arb (though not affecting correctness of Arb itself).
    Users should make sure to install the patched version MPFR 4.0.1.
  * Added missing C++ include guards in arb_fmpz_poly.h and dlog.h (reported
    by Marc Mezzarobba).
  * Fixed Travis builds on Mac OS again (contributed by Isuru Fernando).
  * Added missing declaration for arb_bell_ui() (reported by numsys).

2017-11-29 - version 2.12.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Numerical integration

  * Added a new function (acb_calc_integrate) for rigorous numerical
    integration using adaptive subdivision and Gauss-Legendre quadrature. This
    largely obsoletes the old integration code using Taylor series.

    integrals_taylor.c).

* Discrete Fourier transforms

  * Added acb_dft module with various FFT algorithm implementations, including
    top level O(n log n) acb_dft and acb_dft_inverse functions
    (contributed by Pascal Molin).

* Legendre polynomials

  * Added arb_hypgeom_legendre_p_ui for fast and accurate evaluation of
    Legendre polynomials. This is also used automatically by the Legendre
    functions, where it is substantially faster and gives better error
    bounds than the generic algorithm.
  * Added arb_hypgeom_legendre_p_ui_root for fast computation of Legendre
    polynomial roots and Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes (used internally
    by the new integration code).
  * Added arb_hypgeom_central_bin_ui for fast computation of central
    binomial coefficients (used internally for Legendre polynomials).

* Dirichlet L-functions and zeta functions

  * Fixed a bug in the Riemann zeta function involving a too small error
    bound in the implementation of the Riemann-Siegel formula for inexact
    input. This bug could result in a too small enclosure when evaluating the
    Riemann zeta function at an argument of large imaginary height without
    also computing derivatives, if the input interval was very wide.
  * Add acb_dirichlet_zeta_jet; also made computation of the first derivative
    of Riemann zeta function use the Riemann-Siegel formula where appropriate.
  * Added acb_dirichlet_l_vec_hurwitz for fast simultaneous evaluation of
    Dirichlet L-functions for multiple characters using Hurwitz zeta function
    and FFT (contributed by Pascal Molin).
  * Simplified interface for using hurwitz_precomp functions.
  * Added lcentral.c example program (contributed by Pascal Molin).
  * Improved error bounds when evaluating Dirichlet L-functions using
    Euler product.

* Elementary functions

  * Faster custom implementation of sin, cos at 4600 bits and above
    instead of using MPFR (30-40% asymptotic improvement, up to a factor
    two speedup).
  * Faster code for exp between 4600 and 19000 bits.
  * Improved error bounds for acb_atan by using derivative.
  * Improved error bounds for arb_sinh_cosh, arb_sinh and arb_cosh when
    the input has a small midpoint and large radius.
  * Added reciprocal trigonometric and hyperbolic functions (arb_sec, arb_csc,
    arb_sech, arb_csch, acb_sec, acb_csc, acb_sech, acb_csch).
  * Changed the interface of _acb_vec_unit_roots to take an extra length
    parameter (compatibility-breaking change).
  * Improved arb_pow and acb_pow with an inexact base and a negative integer
    or negative half-integer exponent; the inverse is now computed before
    performing binary exponentiation in this case to avoid spurious blow-up.

* Elliptic functions

  * Improved Jacobi theta functions to reduce the argument modulo the lattice
    parameter, greatly improving speed and numerical stability for large input.
  * Optimized arb_agm by using a final series expansion and using special code
    for wide intervals.
  * Optimized acb_agm1 by using a final series expansion and using special code
    for positive real input.
  * Optimized derivative of AGM for high precision by using a central
    difference instead of a forward difference.
  * Optimized acb_elliptic_rf and acb_elliptic_rj for high precision by using
    a variable length series expansion.

* Other

  * Fixed incorrect handling of subnormals in arf_set_d.
  * Added mag_bin_uiui for bounding binomial coefficients.
  * Added mag_set_d_lower, mag_sqrt_lower, mag_set_d_2exp_fmpz_lower.
  * Implemented multithreaded complex matrix multiplication.
  * Optimized arb_rel_accuracy_bits by adding fast path.
  * Fixed a spurious floating-point exception (division by zero) in the
    t-gauss_period_minpoly test program triggered by new code optimizations
    in recent versions of GCC that are unsafe together with FLINT inline
    assembly functions (a workaround was added to the test code, and a proper
    fix for the assembly code has been added to FLINT).

2017-07-10 - version 2.11.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Avoid use of a function that was unavailable in the latest public FLINT release

2017-07-09 - version 2.11.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Special functions

  * Added the Lambert W function (arb_lambertw, acb_lambertw, arb_poly_lambertw_series, acb_poly_lambertw_series). All complex branches and evaluation of derivatives are supported.
  * Added the acb_expm1 method, complementing arb_expm1.

  * Added a method (arb_fmpz_poly_gauss_period_minpoly) for constructing minimal polynomials of Gaussian periods.
  * Added arb_poly_product_roots_complex for constructing a real polynomial from complex conjugate roots.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    functions, substantially reducing the size of the built library.

    which caused failures on MIPS and ARM systems.

* Basic arithmetic and methods

  * Fixed mag_addmul(x,x,x) with x having a mantissa of all ones. This could
    produce a non-normalized mag_t value, potentially leading to
    incorrect results in arb and acb level arithmetic. This bug was caught by
    new test code, and fortunately would have been hard to trigger accidentally.

  * Added mag_const_pi, mag_sub, mag_expinv.

  * Added arb_intersection (contributed by Alex Griffing).
  * Added arb_min, arb_max (contributed by Alex Griffing).

The geometric series bound is nearly tight for 2F1, and the incorrect version caused immediate test failures for that function. Theoretically, this bug affected correctness of some previously-implemented functions that relied on acb_hypgeom_pfq_series_direct (such as Bessel Y and K functions of integer order), but since the geometric bound is not as tight in those cases, those functions were still reliable in practice (no failing test case has been found).
