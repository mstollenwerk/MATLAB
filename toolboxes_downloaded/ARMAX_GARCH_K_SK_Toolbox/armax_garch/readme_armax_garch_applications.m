%% Applications 
% The following examples will guide you through some of the functionality built in this toolbox. 
% Specifically, how to estimate the models, forecast, simulate and find the best model that 
% fits your data set based on a set of criteria.
%
% The data used for the examples are daily prices of the FTSE 100 index, Barclays and BP for
% the period from 03/01/2000 to 31/12/2010, which is available from finance.yahoo.com.

%% Ordinary Least Square Regression
% To estimate a simple ordinary least square regression the garch function is applied. Lets assume we regress the Barclays 
% and BP on the FTSE 100 index. The results reveal that the both Barclays and BP are positive and statistical significant
% and are able to explain 68% of the variation in the FTSE 100. 
[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht, resids, summary] = garch(data(:,1),'GARCH','GAUSSIAN',0,0,data(:,2:3),0,0,0,[],options);

%%
% However, In case we wanted to incorporate past terms of the FTSE 100 then we can include AR(p) terms. For example the 1-day lag 
% can be included as:
[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht, resids, summary] = garch(data(:,1),'GARCH','GAUSSIAN',1,0,data(:,2:3),0,0,0,[],options);

%% Estimating GARCH models
% This example illustrates how to estimate the ARMAX(1,1,0)-GARCH(1,1) model using the garch function, as well as plot the FTSE 100, its
% estimate variance and residuals using the garchplot function. The inputs are the GARCH model the distribution and the  
% AR(1), MA(1), X(0), ARCH(1), GARCH(1), Y(0),  followed with some additional options. The outputs contain the 
% estimated parameters, standard errors, value of the loglikelihood function, conditional variance, residuals and summary 
% of a variety of statistics such as robust standard errors and scores, among others.
[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht, resids, summary] = garch(data(:,1),'GARCH', 'GAUSSIAN',1,1,0,1,1,0,[],options);
%%
garchplot(data(:,1),ht,resids)

%%
% However, we may also be interested to examine the impact of a number of  factors on the volatility process. In our example 
% the impact of Barclay on the volatility process of FTSE 100. Please note that to estimate a factor GARCH model the 
% (y) factor vector needs to be positive. This means that the factor vectors will be squared. 
y=data(:,2).^2;
[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht, resids, summary] = garch(data(:,1),'GARCH', 'GAUSSIAN',1,1,0,1,1,y,[],options);


%% Forecasting Volatility
% The garchfor and garchfor2 functions are applied to forecast the mean and volatility processes. The inputs of the 
% functions are the GARCH model, distribution the number of forecasted periods. The difference between the two functions 
% is that the former estimates the GARCH model whereas the later passes the already estimated parameters to the function.
% In this example we  will forecast 10 days ahead using the ARMAX(1,1,0)-GARCH(1,1,0) model.The mean and volatility 
% forecasts will be saved in the MF and VF vectors, and the cumulative (or multiperiod holdings) mean and volatility 
% forecasts in MC and VC respectively:
[MF, VF, MC, VC] = garchfor2(data(:,1), resids, ht, parameters, 'GARCH', 'GAUSSIAN',1,1,1,1,10);
[MF,VF, MC, VC]

%% Estimating Value-at-Risk
% The garchvar and garchvar2 functions are applied to estimate Value-at-Risk for for both long and short positions.
% The inputs of the functions are GARCH model, the distribution, the number of forecasted periods and a% losses. 
% The VaR is estimated as:
%
% $$VaR_t = {\widehat{\mu}_{t+n}}+{\Phi}(a)^{-1}{\widehat{\sigma}_{t+n}}$
%
% where:
%
% $${\widehat{\mu}_{t+n}}, \ is \ a \ forecast \ of \ the \ conditional \ mean$
% $${\Phi}(a)^{-1}, \ the \ corresponding \ empirical \ quantile \ of \ the \ assumed \ distribution$
% $${\widehat{\sigma}_{t+n}}, \ is \ a \ forecast \ of \ the \ conditional \ volatility$.
%
% In this exampe we will forecast 10 days ahead 99% VaR estimates using the ARMAX(0,0,0)-GARCH(1,1,0) model 
% with gaussian innovation terms. The long  and short positions will be saved in the VaR variable:
VaR99 = garchvar2(data(:,1),resids, ht, parameters, 'GARCH', 'GAUSSIAN', 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 0.99);
VaR99

%% GARCH Simulation
% The garchsim function is applied to simulate volatility and returns series. It's inputs are the GARCH parameters, 
% model, distribution, the ARCH and GARCH effects, number of samples and number of paths. Additionally a vector of 
% time series of positive pre-sample conditional standard deviations may be provided, which the variance model
% will be conditioned. Make sure however that this vector has sufficient observations in order to initialize the 
% conditional variance process. The outputs are a vector of simulated returns with GARCH variances and a vector of 
% conditional standard deviations. In this example we will simulate 5 paths of 100 days ahead based on the volatility 
% estimate at date 13/08/2010 (i.e. 100 days before the end of the sample) of the ARMAX(0,0,0)-GARCH(1,1) model. 
% Then plot the realized and simulated returns and conditional variances. 
options.OutputResults = 'off';
[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht, resids, summary] = garch(data(1:end-100,1),'GARCH', 'GAUSSIAN',0,0,0,1,1,0,[],options);
[Returns, Sigmas] = garchsim(parameters(2:end), 'GARCH', 'GAUSSIAN', 1, 1, [], 0, 100,5);

holder1=nan(size(data(:,1),1),5);
holder1(end-99:end,:) = Returns;

%% Comparing the conditional variance with different innovation distributions
% This example shows how it is possible to compare the estimated conditional variance of the ARMAX(1,1,0)-GARCH(1,1,0) with 
% different innovation distributions.

% Estimate the models
for j = 1:size(distributions,1)
    eval(['[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht_temp] = garch(data(:,1), ''GARCH'',''', strcat(distributions(j,:)), ''',1,1,0,1,1,0,[],options);']);
    ht(:,j) = ht_temp;
end

%% Finding the best model to fit the distributional characteristics
% This example presents the garchfind function  that finds the best specification that fits the data based on a set 
% of criteria (i.e. has the largest log likelihood value and the smallest AIC and BIC criteria).
%
% We apply garchfind on GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1) and NGARCH(1,1) with Gaussian, Student't, and Generalizate innovation 
% distributions. This example can be extended to incorporate all the supported models, innovation distributions found 
% in the ARMAX-GARCH toolbox and for any order AR, MA, ARCH and GARCH effects.
%
% Please note that this may take some time.
options.OutputResults = 'off';

% Two characters vectors are created to save the selected models and distributions. These are then are passed to the garchfind function
models = char('GARCH', 'GJR', 'EGARCH');
distributions = char('GAUSSIAN', 'T', 'GED');
[parameters, stderrors, LLF, ht, resids, summary] = garchfind(data(:,1), models, distributions, 1, 1, 1, 1, options);

%% Applications in Volatility Forecasting & Value-at-Risk  
% garchvolfor permits the comparison of volatility and Value-at-Risk estimates for a data vector and for a variety of GARCH 
% models and distribution at different forecast periods (i.e. max_forecasts) as well as sort the results according to only 
% a sub-set of preferred forecast periods.
%
% In this example we forecast volatility and estimate VaR for upto to 22 days(max_forecasts = 22). However, we are only 
% interested for the 1-day, 1- and 2-weeks and 1-month trading periods and therefore we specify int_forecasts as [1, 5, 10, 22]. 
% Additionally, VaR forecasts are estimated by specifying a vector of a% losses. For example we may be interested in the 
% 95% and 99% losses and thus alpha = [0.95;0.99].  
%
% garchvolfor also allows the estimation of a rolling window forecasts for example: lets  assume that our sample consists of 
% 1000 observations, we want to estimate the volatility and VaR forecasts for the past 100 days therefore we set P = 100. 
%
% This function also permits the estimation of a number volatility loss functions such as: mean square error, R2LOG, among 
% others; as well as a number of VaR back-testing metrics such as conditional coverage, interval and regulatory tests.
% For more information which tests are included please refer the VFLF and VaRLR functios
%
% Other features of garchvolfor are
% 1. Organization of results based either by model or by series names.
% 2. Plotting of the volatility and VaR forecasts by adjusting the fieldsin the options variables which include series names, 
% time steps, size of plots and a path where the plots are to be saved.  
%
% Please note, that in this example the evaluation metrics are estimated based on the differences between forecasted variance 
% and squared realised returns. This application can be extended to incorporate for example realized volatilities.

%% 
% The first example will estimate 100 volatility forecasts of 22 days ahead estimates but we are interested only in the 1-day and 
% 2-trading weeks ahead estimates. Moreover, we want to estimate the 95% and 99% of VaR losses. Finally, we want  all the results to 
% be formatted according to the name of the index (i.e. FTSE100, Barclays and BP). This will take some time!
